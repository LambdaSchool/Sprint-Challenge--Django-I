## Prepare Your Project 

1. Confused, does `Copy the dotenv file in this repository to .env in your repository (this should not be checked in)` mean we are replacing the old with this one?

## Deploying

1. Keep getting issues with requirements.txt. It loads all my window dependencies and not just the ones i worked with. I'm assuming its because i didn't pipenv shell but unsure.

2. Just constant errors back to back, slowly losing sanity.
  "decouple.UndefinedValueError: SECRET_KEY not found. Declare it as envvar or define a default value"
  " Error while running '$ python Intro_Django/manage.py collectstatic --noinput'. See traceback above for details."

3. After trying to fix so many errors i get, `Your account has reached its concurrent builds limit`. Just about done with this project, going to throw in the towel on this.
