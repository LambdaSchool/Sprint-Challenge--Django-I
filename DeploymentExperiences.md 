experience - 

got stuck at 2 places! 

1. in setting.py the position of the static file for white noise, turns out it cant be on top. requires it to be at bottom

2. on heroku - configuring database for postgres. took 10 deploys to figure that thing out! 


how far - completely deployed on heroku. working!
