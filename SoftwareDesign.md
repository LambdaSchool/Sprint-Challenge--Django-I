# Software Design

* __Favorite software design pattern__:
  * The __*Iterator*__ pattern, became my favorite software design pattern because of how fundamental it is to solving certain problems. I began to realize how widely it's used across different programming languages regardless of their paradigms. One situation where the iterator pattern would be useful is when querying a database for a specific record, while _not_ exposing the underlying database.

* __Encounter with a software design anti-pattern__:
  * Every now and then I find myself falling into the habit or anti-pattern known as _**Programming by permutation**_. This software design anti-pattern occurs when a programmer attempts to solve a problem by successively modifying code to see if it will eventually "just work". At times the line between debugging and _PBP_ blurs, but I try to periodically ask myself questions like; what is the _intent_ behind this change?, or what am I expecting this code to do _after_ this change? In my experience when I do remember to ask myself questions like these, I can efficiently debug code, and avoid sliding into _PBP_.
