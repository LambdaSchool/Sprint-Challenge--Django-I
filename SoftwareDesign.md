I really enjoy the MVC design pattern, probably because I have the most familiarity with it. I'm reading about patterns more, as another Dev I met with reccommended the same book that Aaron did: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software. I had actually purchased it a few weeks ago but hadn't cracked it open yet.

I'm reading through it now and trying to absorb as much as possible.

My favorite anti-pattern is probably rewriting code unncessarily, because I find myself doing it too much. In fact, the less I plan my code out ahead of time, the more repetitive I am. If I plan ahead I can make a plan to write reusable code and that generally helps me a lot.
