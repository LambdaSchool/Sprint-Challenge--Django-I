I really enjoyed utilizing the pipenc package to install and create a development envrironment. 
I have always been very intrigued by working on projects like this as I think its a little easier when 
you are handling so many different packages. I think this would be useful in high production environments especially 
when you are trying to add new funsctionalty to something and don't want to break what is already 
working. I really like Docker whcih does something similar and is a good tool as well for deployment and
 this reminded me of it a bit.
 
An anti-pattern I encountered, and one that I have been doing a lot, is not commiting often and not
utilizing dev environments in a lot of my projects. In the past this has made it difficult to 
reverse any mistakes I made. I utilized some of what I learned this week to get out of that habit
and make it easier for me in general to play around without breaking to much.
