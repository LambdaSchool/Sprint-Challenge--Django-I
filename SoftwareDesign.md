### Software Design
1. Favorite Design Pattern
> Of the few I've had time to study this week, the `lazy initialization` has to be my favorite. Being able to delay creation of an object, calculation of a value, or any other expensive process just seems too good to be true. From a database standpoint, this would be a great way to create a database connection, but only at the point you need to retrieve data from that database. In a larger application, this allows the user to install or get only what they need as they need it, instead of having to wait for all features to install up front.

2. Anti-pattern
> During the initial stages of being here at Lambda, I was often guilty of `copy-pasta programming`. When so many new concepts were being thrown at me right away, it was first helpful to see how other people attacked the same problems. But it is absolutely a slippery slope and very easy to just search out answers elsewhere instead of working on the problem myself. Since then, I've learned a lot more about how to tackle such problems on my own and the need/urge to seek out answers has diminished.
