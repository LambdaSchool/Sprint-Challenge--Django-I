*Favorite Design Pattern: Model View Controller*


I really enjoy the MVC design pattern, probably because I have the most familiarity with it. I have used it before with Full Stack Javascript Code, and I am gaining familiarity with using it while coding in Python and Django. 


I'm reading about patterns more, as another Dev I met with reccommended the same book that Aaron did: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software. I had actually purchased it a few weeks ago but hadn't cracked it open yet.


I'm reading through it now and trying to absorb as much as possible.


*Favorite Design Anti-Pattern: WET (Write Every Time) Code*


I find myself doing this far too much. In fact, the less I plan my code out ahead of time, the more repetitive I am. If I plan ahead, I can make a plan to write reusable code and that generally helps me a lot when it comes to writing DRY code.
