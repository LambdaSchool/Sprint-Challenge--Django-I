My favorite software design pattern would have to be the Factory Method. I believe I have used it substantially with python and javascript's class system. I like creating re-useable things and being lazy. As for anti-patterns, I am a total cargo cult programmer. I often do not understand much of what is happening behind the scenes with external packages. The solution to this is ongoing, as I have to constantly research the new things web development throws at me!
