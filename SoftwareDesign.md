## Software Design

#### My favorite software design is Test Driven Development. Writing tests before writing the code guides one. If the developer wrote a code yesterday and had all the tests to pass and the build to pass. Today the developer introduced a new feature forgot to run the test but made sure the build passed. A day later users complaining of a bug, a feature that was working but suddenly stopped working. The developer can run the tests and see what happened. Implmenting the features broke the passing tests of the old feature. 

#### One software anti-design pattern I ran into was Spaghetti code
