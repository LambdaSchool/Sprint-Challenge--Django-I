I enjoy using the observer behavorial pattern. Best way to explain it is Redux. It lets many items/components access one true state. All components rely on that one app state for all its data, and will update automatically when the app data is updated.

Whenever I start a new project is all looks like a big ball of mud. I know what is needed, but structuring it in a way that isnt foreign to an outside developer takes some time.
