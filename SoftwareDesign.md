# My favorite design pattern
 
 ## Module Design Pattern
 - Module desing pattern is my favorite one that I have learned about it this week, and I already have been using it almost from the beginning of the program. 
 - In JavaScript, and other languages, modules are the most prevalently used design patterns for keeping particular pieces of code independent of other components. This provides loose coupling to support well-structured code

 ## Anti Pattern expereince
 - I once run into anti-pattern problem. In object-oriented programming, an anti-pattern is a 'God object' or a very very huge object which performs a lot of functions which would be better separated into different objects. In my personal project I created only one object for the whole application. Then I realized that it is very hard to read and maintain. I finally used the module design pattern to get rid of the problem.
