My favorite Software Development patterns are:
- State - When I design something it makes the most sense for it to be encapsulated and manage itself. This is the reason I enjoy React. The idea of having small building blocks that fit into a larger machine.
- Blockchain - Technology is exciting because it begs the question 'What we remove humans completely from and automate?'. Blockchains solve the issue of trust between unknown parties. It creates immutable and tamper-proof data. The future implications are what got me into development in the first place.

A common anti-pattern I fall into the trap of is Copy and paste programming. This has become an issue when I have copied code I used earlier in the project but forgot to change a variable name or introduced a typo causing a very hard to debug problem. To fix this I used a combination of console logging and retracing my steps to find the bug.
