My Favorite pattern in Observer because it is what I use the most. Almost everything we write for the web is event based and waits to do something until called. The frontend will send some action, the backend will respond and the frontend will do something again.

An Anti pattern I have run into is lasagna code because I will try to be clever and write code that will depend on other code leading to a lot of layers of abstraction.
I am trying to keep it simple with 1 to maybe 2 layers of abstraction.
