Though it was extremely brief observers/observables are very interesting and powerful (rxJS etc) because they allow for very powerfully flexible code that can react to all sorts of events asynchronously (such as user input).

I'm often guilty of creating accidental complexity as a result of not thinking through the problem enough before starting to write the solution. I'm aware of it and have been trying to stop and think more.
