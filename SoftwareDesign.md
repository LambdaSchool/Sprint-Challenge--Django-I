#### Favorite Design Pattern: MVC

Modal-View-Controller commonly known as MVC is my favorite software design pattern. 
Code-reusability is the main advantage that I find in MVC pattern. Also it helps in
organizing the code-base in different pieces of code, so that it makes it easy for
us to maintain the code. Adding a new feature or to debug, MVC makes it easy for
developers than most other design patterns.

#### Anti-Pattern: WET Code

I have run into WET multiple times in my workflow. But I don't think that is a huge
problem because in most cases the WET issue is resolved after code refactoring.
