Favorite Software Design Pattern:

* I think the most interesting SDP that we discussed during our class on Thursday was the Singleton SDP, which is where a single instance of a class is made and globally accessible throughout the program. I imagine this would be very useful in Game Development, which is an area that I am wanting to start my first self-designed mini project in.

Favorite Software Design Anti-Pattern:

* I mentioned in our 1:1 that Singleton Overuse or as Joshua Kerievsky calls it, "Singletonitis", is an appropriate anti-pattern since it points out some of the major flaws in what is otherwise a very enticing idea to implement just about anywhere.  Kerievsky, along with many others, points out that simply put, writing a Singleton just does not make sense, when it is simpler to pass an object resource as a reference to the specific objects that need it. I'll have to read more into it, but there are doubtless other important reasons for not using Singletons.
