1.  I can't say that I have a favorite software design pattern that I learned this week, but one that comes to mind is Singleton. It seems to be a very common pattern used in many frameworks that I've seen. A Singleton pattern limits the instantion of a class to one object. In my opinion, implementing Singleton patterns makes the code very readable, and I can see that being quite useful when working on a large project with many developers. Lastly, I would only use this pattern when necessary to avoid overusing or using it unecessarily in a large codebase.

2.  A software anti-pattern I've run into is definitely Spaghetti. When I first started learning JavaScript, a lot of my code fell into this category. It's extremely difficult to read and looks sloppy. As I learned more software design patterns and by working with frameworks that have common patterns, I quickly learned ways to avoid spaghetti code. The best remedy to this anti-pattern is simply refactoring and cleaning up your code.
