### Design Pattern
While I can't say I have a favorite, talking with Beej had gotten me interested in Observer patterns. The way he explained it was with event listeners, where one action would activate an event listener, that would in turn activate another, and another, and so on. It seems really interesting in that aspect, and something I would definitely like to explore and see how it works and comes together.

### Anti-Design Pattern
When I first started out, I was bad with two things:
 * Copy/paste programming
 * Spaghetti Code

Copy/paste was bad for me before I started Lambda. I was a kid, toying with the idea of Software Development. I would find code that could be used in games and such, and copy/paste it, run the function and HUZZAH! I'm a hacker/wizard proud kid that created his own functioning script. It wasn't until I was older that I realized that did me no good. I was sure good at it, but I couldn't come up with code on my own. So it took a lot of time and practice to improve that, which was a step I wanted to take before getting in to any sort of school for software development.

Spaghetti code. For a good while I would just write line after line, function upon function, until it was a big, working, mess. I couldn't care less how it looked. It worked. I was successful. Until I decided to go back to those old programs and try to improve them. To this day I still couldn't say what was going on in them! Lesson learned: Write cleaner code and understand/comment/define EVERYTHING.
