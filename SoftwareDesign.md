#Your favorite software design pattern you learned this week, why, and a situation you think it'd be useful

###The Observer Pattern was pretty interesting to me, where when a subject is changed, all of its observers are updated. This would be very useful in a video game, where the subject is a game managewr object that holds all of the player data, and when it is updated, all the observers are updated with the player data to make the next calculations.


#A software design anti-pattern that you've run into, what happened, and what you did to fix the situation

###One anti-pattern that I have run into,though not that often, is disorganized/sloppy coding which makes everything just so much harder to read. When I first code something, I just try to get it working, then I usually go back and make it prettier, but sometimes I forget. To fix it, I have added a text formatter that I like to my VS code, and I wil probably try to comment in my code so I can know whats happening at a glance
