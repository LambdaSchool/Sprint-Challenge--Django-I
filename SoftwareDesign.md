- Your favorite software design pattern you learned this week, why, and a situation you think it'd be useful
- A software design anti-pattern that you've run into, what happened, and what you did to fix the situation

Favourite Pattern:
  My favourite software design pattern that we learned about this week would have to be builder/factory patterns. This is commonly used in Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and involves using one or more classes to create objects. Other classes may be able to inherit and modify their properties, and the data is immediately usable. I think this type of programming is very familiar for me as I've spent a lot of time using Java, which is incredibly popular for its OOP principles. Python and JavaScript are also incredibly capable of supporting OOP design patterns and when they work, it feels like magic. I love it.  It allows you to take a complicated set of data and spin up and modify instances of it with ease, which is an incredibly powerful way of thinking, especially when we're training to become developers in ecosystems like React.

Antipattern:
  The antipattern I've run into in the past (and I think everyone has before) is popularly referred to as "The Blob". This is when one object or function takes a lion's share of responsibilities and computations, while everything else in the project only holds data or executes very simple processes. An example everyone can relate to is when we were beginning Web Dev and programmers would use one single `script.js` file that would contain 50 different functions and handle ALL of the data and modifications on the website. This is not efficient and can be a nightmare to debug if there are problems. Refactoring this into a lot of smaller, easier to digest files makes debugging a breeze and distributes the responsibilities a lot more uniformly. It also allows the programmer to isolate the effects of the changes he or she makes, so it's easier to iterate and continue building upon the project.
