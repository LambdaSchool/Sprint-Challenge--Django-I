1.  Your favorite software design pattern you learned this week, why, and a situation you think it'd be useful

_Answer_

My favorite design pattern out of those that we learned this week is the Decorator pattern. I like it because it can assign additional functionality toa n object without major changes to the code. It is also a clean and efficient alternative to using multiple subclasses in order to extend functionality. This pattern makes for efficient and DRY code.

2.  A software design anti-pattern that you've run into, what happened, and what you did to fix the situation  
    _Answer_  
    I have encountered _and created_ the yo-yo problem. Many times, I have lost control of the structure and made the application I was working on overly-fragmented and therefore difficult to understand. I am particularly guilty of this when working in React. The best method to mitigate this problem is to efficiently define the structure with input from all stakeholders before the first line of code is written.
