I found the prototype software design pattern extremely interesting. I could imagine it being useful when creating complex object oriented 
programs to create a 'base' class that all similar objects inherit from.

Analysis paralysis is an anti pattern that I have definitely fallen into especially when starting a new project from scratch. I find that
the impulse to over attempt to prevent orginizational errors that will inevitablly pop up during development can lead to delaying starting 
work on a new porject. I've found that to break this I need to understand that problems during development are unavoidable and that after
a reasonable period of planning you have to just get started inorder to find out which problems will be most consequential.
