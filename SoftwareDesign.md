My favorite software design pattern is probably prototyping. I like the efficiency it lends to processes by preventing unnecessary repetition. It is most useful (I think) in object oriented programming where you have a lot of objects with similar, but slightly different functions. It allows for the easy separation of functionality, and keeps code cleaner and more readable because you have prototypes with well understood behavior to draw from. 

A software anti-pattern I have run across myself is definitely the blob pattern. A situation where one method or object has too many responsibilities or functions and all the rest of the functions are shallow. This is an easy situation to run into when you are first solving a problem and don't have a distinct structure in mind for your solution. More and more tasks get added into the initial method. My solution is usually to identify tasks that are easily stripped out of the main method and assigned their own function.
