My favorite design patterns are OOP and Singleton. It's just more organize and easier to understand comparing to real world objects.

Anti-pattern
Most of the time, due to wanting to get an app up and running, I often jump into coding without thinking about data structure and design pattern. More often than not, I ended up with spaghetti codes. As the code base grows, I often had to refactor the codes and turn them into OOP or Singleton design pattern.
