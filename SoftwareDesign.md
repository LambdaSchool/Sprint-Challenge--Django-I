The idea behind Software Design patterns is a way to further obfuscate good programming practices for newcomers to the field.

However, if I had to choose a favorite, I would choose the Factory method, especially in regards to Python classes and class inheritance. I am interested in making games, so many similar game objects can be placed into a single category. For instance, alien1 and alien2 are both Aliens, and (depending on the game) could also be classified by the broader category of "Enemies". Subclasses can determine the more intricate details, but all objects inside of "Enemies" would share a set of similar characteristics, such as a "targetPlayer()" function.

One software design anti-pattern I have run into is Spaghetti Code. This was the result of my chasing bugs: once I had one set of bugs cleared up, another few popped up. If I had been impatient, I would have kept following the rabbit trail until I ended up with a big pile of spaghetti. To avoid the band-aid patch approach, I took a moment to relax and refocus, then I reviewed the structure that I was going for in my end-product. With a cleared head, I completed the MVP without bugs and with code that was ready to expand and allow more features.
