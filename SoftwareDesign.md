For software design I think my favorite has been object oriented programming. It is something I learned about years ago but never truly grasped the concept or appreciated it until now. I am always trying to figure out ways to lessen the amount of code I have to type out or re use so anything to that effect is very much appreciated. In the end any code that can be reused or understood easier by any other person is the best way to go I have learned, so going on with my career with that in mind can be very useful.
Any anti-pattern I have run into that stuck with me is copy and pasting code. I am guilty of copying somethign I found off the internet as well but when im not being overly lazy, I make sure I understand it before copying it and using it. One of the things I really enjoy about programming is the endless resources there are to learn and one of them being other programmers simply helping out a newcomer with directions or in harder situtations, a straight solution.
