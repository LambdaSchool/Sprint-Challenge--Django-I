Your favorite software design pattern you learned this week, why, and a situation you think it'd be useful
A software design anti-pattern that you've run into, what happened, and what you did to fix the situation

# Software Design Pattern
For now, my favorite design pattern learned this week is the ```prototype pattern```. It's considered a creational software design pattern. It can be used to avoid creating an entirely new object, when you think about the given time/space it may take up in an application. Also, possibly follows the DRY rule.

It's easy to make mistakes quite often when you're new to debugging apps and because of that I've run into anti-patterns quite a lot. The  ```Shotgun-surgery``` anti-pattern of ```git commit -m '4339343 things at a time``` instead of committing one feature at a time. I have been practicing more good design patterns and familarizing myself with anti-patterns so that I may be more aware and capable of fixing the situations.
