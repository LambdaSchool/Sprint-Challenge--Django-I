### Software Design ###
A passion of mine since I was very young, software design to me is the art of creating enteractive applications that create solutions to issues that people encounter everyday. From the basic store front website to the informative blog, we write applications that are solutions to issues we all encounter. To me this is like seeing someone have a dream, and I am like a like a wish granter, and can create that dream. 

Software design, for me at least starts with getting to know what the end results should be. If you can create a clear path of expectations you can create the needed avenues to build the applications overall functionality. Using common well know coding principles, standards, and patterns I enjoy writing software that many will benefit from. 

Through the 20+ years, of writing software I have found that my favorite part is still discovering what the persons dream is and having the ability to bring it to life. As all applications start as a mere thought someone has, a dream that turns to reality and that is my job as I design software I have the honor of bring to life dreams of people who may have never seen them realized.
