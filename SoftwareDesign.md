# Software Design

## Design Patters

My favorite software design pattern that I have encountered this week is the active object pattern. I encountered this pattern while reviewing a complex application with an acquaintance with whom I liaise with upon occasion. He was demonstrating to me a piece code that utilizes that pattern, and we discussed it in depth. It is my favorite design pattern for the week because of it's ability to implement asynchronous method invocation, effectively decoupling method execution and invocation, achieving concurrency. As we deal with many asynchronous issues in development, this is a valuable pattern to take into consideration at times. Though it's application to JavaScript may be limited, and it is more fit for other popular languages such as Java, the awareness of this pattern, and the simplicity of it's theory and basic execution, makes it a valuable pattern to remember.
