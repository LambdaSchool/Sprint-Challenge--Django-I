* It was a pattern packed with functionality. Best of both worlds. This wasn't theoretical functionality, but simply naming functions that are hidden from the current programming level, that both label and code for you.

* Anti-Pattern: I was the worst offender of the copypasta anti-pattern when I started Lambda. I honestly believed I was learning from pasted code and reading through it the same way I would have had I typed it out character for charachter. Now, the closest I get to that is to transcribe it line for line by hand while giving an entire commment block/line for every single line of code. I will NOT move forward without an understanding of that line of code.
