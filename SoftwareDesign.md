My favorite software design pattern is the State pattern because it's probably what React is modeled after. I personally enjoy using React and React Native so I have experienced the usefulness of it. Changing the object based on the state makes sense since it's something that is in line with how a user interacts with a website. If a user clicks on a button, then the state changes for that button changes, which is reflected in the button's components code. 

A software design anti-pattern that I've run into as a beginner with my own code has been spaghetti code. While adding more functions to a project without any regard for organizition, it became a lot harder to understand the flow of everything, which made it hard to solve bug issues. I had to re-order everthing by moving my functions around and grouping them accordingly. This made it easier to understand for myself and for anybody else who might read my code.
