# Favorite Software Design Pattern

I love the prototypal pattern, a hallmark of JavaScript. I strongly dislike over-engineered and rigid solutions to problems that will limit my flexibility in the future. What is great about the prototype pattern is that not only are you not getting trapped by class hierachy (since you are just cloning objects), you also avoid any overhead from having to instantiate an object using a constructor.

# Favorite Anti-Pattern :)

Premature optimization is definitely something I have struggled with. Perfectionist tendencies lead me to spending too much time trying to visualize the optimal solution when a pretty good solution could have already been implemented. I'm trying to make myself do what works and be happy with that first, and only consider improving things if absolutely necessary (for example, if the performance is actually impeding usability)
