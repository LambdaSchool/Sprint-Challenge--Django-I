My favorite software design pattern would still be an Interpreter Pattern. This stuck out to me due to a linguistic background, but it ended up being rather interesting. It can be used to define simple languages, or subsets of more fleshed out, complete languages. I think it would be useful in situations with abstract syntax trees or with SQL-data languages to put either into context for the client process. 

Coding by exception is an anti-pattern I run into pretty regularly. In particular in views.py for this project could run into random errors depending which method was called for the http request, get an error, and append another section of code to fix it. A more general approach I've taken to combat this in general is to try to think of edge cases right off the bat so I can use an algorithm that might include those and not add multiple if...else sections onto future code.
