- A `SoftwareDesign.md` file where you write about:
    - Your favorite software design pattern you learned this week, why, and a situation you think it'd be useful
    - A software design anti-pattern that you've run into, what happened, and what you did to fix the situation

For both writing portions, this is meant to practice your skills at
*professional* writing - in the tech world, that means writing things clearly,
concisely, in a way to get the information across efficiently to an audience
that may be pretty busy (most people only skim most emails). Suggested length
~1-2 paragraphs for each topic, and bullet lists can be extremely effective.

My favorite software design pattern that I learned this week is the Prototype Pattern. I feel like this pattern saved a lot of time in building boilerplates. If I were to write this exact program from scratch, I feel like I would definitely take more than a week to complete it. This pattern would be extremely useful in creating instant objects of similar nature.

A software design anti-pattern that I run into quite frequently is the Copy and Paste design. Especially when there is a project and I am unsure of what to do, I ahve a habit of copying the code I see in the docs that I am reading. This brings up a lot of errors since the copied code is not specified to mine. To fix this situation, I had to review the code that I am trying to implement and adjust it accordingly.
