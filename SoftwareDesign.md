The most intriguing software design pattern I learned about this week was a Behavioral pattern called _Iterator_. This is because all too often there is an object, or objects, I am working with that do not have a built-in way to be iterated over. As such implementing an iterator for such objects is definitely a functional requirement.

For anti-patterns, I have had the displeasure of dealing with _Magic numbers_ all too often. This occurred when I was working on the code for CubeSat satellites and there were not only single letter variable names everywhere but also _Magic numbers_ with absolutely no explanation, comments, or documentation. It took months to reverse engineer these numbers and then consulting with the program director to ascertain their meaning. All I can say is from that bad experience I swore I would never do that to someone else!
