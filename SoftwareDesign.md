## Favorite software design pattern:
- Prototype is one design pattern that I've encountered and have benefitted from using. It's useful in that it allows me to create classes and then inherit their properties and methods without having to create each from scratch. Redefining a parent's methods in the child is something I just learned about as well when reading about OOP and polymorphism. Very useful.


## Anti-patterns I've encountered:
- Magic numbers are an anti-pattern that I run into frequently. It's too easy to simply insert the numbers that are needed without explanation, but I now realize how difficult this makes it to maintain in the future. I'm making an effort to stop putting in these unexplained numbers and instead declaring variables with good names and proper comments to remove the mystery surrounding them.
