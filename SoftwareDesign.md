A design pattern I'm interested in, but haven't necessarily implemented one of my own, is blockchain. After reading articles covering blockchain implementation, albeit mainly for cryptocurrency exchanges, the idea of a decentralized way to store and access data has always captivated me.

A design pattern I've utilized most has been the Factory Method, declaring classes and their subclasses that inherit behavior from their super classes. I was first exposed to this software design pattern when I dabbled in Java at uni. I like how it modularizes the app. It's made learning Python enjoyable.

The worst anti-pattern that I'm guilty of falling into its trap has been cargo cult programming, where I'll use code that I don't understand completely. Even when learning from a live human, I have seen teaching styles encourage this.
e.g. "How did you do xyz task?"
friend: "Oh I've just the line for that."
_shows line or googles explanation/answer, coding continues, another question arises, cult programming snowballs_

To combat this, one must be ok to learn slowly. If you easily forget how you accomplished a task, _write it down_. Handwrite notes on a legal pad while you program, especially detailing those major that are headaches. It can be very helpful.
