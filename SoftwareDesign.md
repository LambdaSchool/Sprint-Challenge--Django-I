## Favorite Software design Pattern:

### Not sure if I have a 'favorite,' but the Factory method reminds me a lot of classes, subclasses and various other parent/child relationships I have come across.

## Anti-patterns I have run into

### Quite a few here:

\*Bleeding edge is one that people face these days whether they like it or not. Windows 10 in particular, now updates automatically, so there is always a chance that there will be a conflict there in regard to software. I prefer to wait a few weeks before installing updates, except for critical security update. Really, I have run into most of these on the list from wikipedia ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern ) and have been guilty of a few of them too. Great learning resource is to what should be avoided.
