A `SoftwareDesign.md` file where you write about: - Your favorite software design pattern you learned this week, why, and a situation you think it'd be useful - A software design anti-pattern that you've run into, what happened, and what you did to fix the situation

Reading over the software design patterns wiki, it's hard to pick just one to talk about but I think my one that would be in my top three would be in the behavioral patterns and it's the Template method. It says it defines the skelton of an operation deferring steps to subclasses. This method allows the subclasses to redefine steps without changing the structure of an algorithm.
