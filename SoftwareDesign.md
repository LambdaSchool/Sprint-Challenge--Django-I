## Patterns / Anti-Patterns

#### Best Design Pattern
My favorite design patterns involve re-usability. In terms of creational patterns, I like the Prototype pattern since creating skeleton code usually aids in figuring out what optimizations need to be done later in development.

#### Anti Patterns
The most common anti-pattern I run into is repetitive/redundancies. I usually try to eliminate these (WET) by creating variable holders for commonly used inputs/declarations.
