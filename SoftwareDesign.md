# Software Design Pattern

    The Observer pattern would have to be my "favorite" because we have used it a lot in javascript specifically as an example with clickHandlers or any  other event handler in general. When clicking on something inside a browser the clickHandler will will notify the state automatically of any changes by calling the method.

# Anti-Pattern

    The anti-pattern I have most frequently run into is magic numbers, as I'm starting my code early on in the project I tend to  have magic numbers and by  the time I get to the end I have a lot of magic numbers spread throughout the code. The main  thing I have started doingis accessing what piece of code I'm writing and determining whether or not there is a mgic number, or a number that I'll have to change frequently or adjust  as I'm going through the project to make abetter outcome and set that number to a variable expecially if I'm using it in different places.
