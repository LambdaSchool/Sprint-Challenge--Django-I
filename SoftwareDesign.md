My favorite design pattern that I learned this week was definitely Object Oriented Programming. I have predilection towards this pattern because it is very effective at condensing bigger problems into bit-sized solutions. I believe that its all about looking at the bigger picture and effectively fragmenting that picture into smaller, easier to solve problems. Object Oriented Programming has its flaws but its the most simple and intuitively intrinsic way to solve problems.
