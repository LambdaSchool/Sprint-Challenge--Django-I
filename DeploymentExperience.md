#Deployment

The deployment went smoothly. I have deployed many times to GHPages, Netlify, Heroku, mLab, Azure, and other services. Specifically, I deployed my server for the full stack project to Heroku, and deployed another server to Heroku as part of an almost flawless 30 minute live demo. Overall I feel comfortable in adapting to deployment in different environments, and have the experience and the tools to manage any problems that may arise. The only issues that happened in this case were my attempt to login to Heroku from the CLI failed, as the Heroku-CLI was not up to date. This was solved by updating Heroku. The only other problem I had was following deployment, I was getting a 400 (Bad Request) error rendered. On a whim, as I had wondered as I set the ALLOWED_HOSTS in Heroku, I edited this in the config variables, from my full URL, to simply the more general `.herokuapp.com`, which solved the problem. The site was fully functional as it had been locally, and worked seamlessly.
