I have no idea where my bug is, so I have no way of knowing (for certain) what went well and what will prove to be my Judas.  :)  This is the most honest answer I have for what went well vs didn't. 

Everything I attempted to do felt pretty smoothe and only took a couple tries at most. So all in all, it didn't feel too bad until it didn't work at all.
