I had multiple errors along the way which could have easily been solved or avoided:

* Deployment issues due to config var
    -I've never used them so it was strange to set it up

* Local Enviornment issues 
    -Some imports weren't woriking on my enviornment however they passed the build into Heroku

* Failure to read instructions clearly
    -Learned my lesson to thoroughly read documentation provided


It was interesting deploying to Heroku even though I was error-prone along the way. However the errors Heroku gave out were clear and concise, so the issues were easily fixed after a bit of reading. While deployment could have gone smoother I learned a lot along the way and was also given the opportunity to touch up on using a deployment service such as Heroku.
