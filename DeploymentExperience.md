The deployment experience for me was a bit challenging and but I liked it because I learned a lot along the way. 
I went through the steps that were explained, I installed all the dependencies that were needed. Things got a bit challenging and tricky when adding the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` and the `DATABASE_URL`. I had to do a bit of researching to find out what I had to enter for the them. Getting the `SECRET_KEY`, gave be a hard time because I was overthinking it, then reading carefully and trying it step by step, I generated a secret key. Creating the heroku app went well, now the deploying part was a challenging. I was able to deploy through heroku but I kept getting an application error. Still working through the error to find the issue.
