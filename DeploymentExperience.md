The deployment was unsuccessful because of the `collectstatic` command run during pushing to Heroku. Solutions provided in the Heroku documentation did not work, nor did `whitenoise`. I thought perhaps it was a Python version issue, because I had changed from version 3.7 to 3.6.6 in my pipenv, but after removing that environment and creating a new one, the error now reads `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/tmp/build_42d2dbfb70fc68bb7dad9713603a5f4e/static'`. 

Heroku suggests you can turn off the `collectstatic` command during a push, but it seems as if `whitenoise` is not configured properly and I have not found a solution yet.
