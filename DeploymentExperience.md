Unfortunately, I haven't been able to get it deploy I am getting a push rejected to djorga after verification.
It has been quite an experience, I definitely want to get it deployed but figuring out why I am getting the rejection error.
My dependencies installed successfully & documents were easily written to follow, I am looking forward to getting it deployed & see it work though!

Overall great experience!
