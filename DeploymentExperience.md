So far, the deployment process for this project is a real doozy. Getting initially deployed was relativly easy, just followed the instructions and some documentations online. Deployed succesfully to heroku, though going to the actual webpage returns errors. Changed a lot of varibles and figured out some. Site is live but gives 500 errors. After the deployment process I checked to see if it would run locally, something is broken.. But I deleted like 1-2 lines of code and redeployed and everything is working. Frustrating but the experience is def worth it.
