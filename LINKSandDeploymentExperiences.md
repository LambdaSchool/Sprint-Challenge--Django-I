Experiences:
As far as my deployment experiences went, everything went rather smoothly. That was probably the most concerning thing, that there wasn't any problems. There's usually at least a few problems everytime I do anything, but I guess the directions were so concise that there weren't too many.

I did have an issue using my bash terminal with python/django on Windows 10. That was quickly solved by switching to powershell. Also, solving the ALLOWED_HOST settings was actually difficult. The answer ended up being very simple.
