i had to set up some stuff in bash, because i could not get heroku working in ubuntu
everything went fine step to step, but i was getting unexpected errors.
googling my errors did not really help.
i checked my heroku logs.
everything will be working soon, my server is locally working fine, it's just the heroku migrations issue
