- A `DeploymentExperiences.md` file where you write summarizing how the process went for you, what went well and what was tricky, and how far you got

For the writing portion, this is meant to practice your skills at
*professional* writing - in the tech world, that means writing things clearly,
concisely, in a way to get the information across efficiently to an audience
that may be pretty busy (most people only skim most emails). Suggested length
~1-2 paragraphs, and bullet lists can be extremely effective.

Deploying Django was far more complicated than previous deployment attemps. That said I feel like I have leveled up in my abiliity to deploy. What went well was the great instructions that were layed out in the README. What could have gone better was following those directions. I missed importing cors in the python shell, ordering correctly and labeling the project name correctly in the Procfile. I got it completly deployed however so I am very pleased about that and I glad that we had the chance to start it early as I don't know if I would have gotten it done in 3 hours.
