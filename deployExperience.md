My deployment went smoothly at the beginning,just followed instructions in the readme file and watched the video from After Hours. I did get stuck on an issue that was trouble, turns out it was a missing hyphen. Once that issue was solved deployment was finished. I like Django, just had some difficulty understanding what was going on sometimes.
