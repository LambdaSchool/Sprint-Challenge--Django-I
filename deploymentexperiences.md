Project Repo: https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Intro-Django/pull/22

Live Site: Deployed but with errors.  Check back.

Experiences:  Nothing in the project was especially tricky.  I was able to add depencies without an issue.  Project log errors currently running clean, but heroku indicates that there are errors.   The project itself is barebones, but complete and ready to deploy.   As usual, the obstacle comes down to debugging any final errors between the code and deployment.
