I don't mind deploying, but there is a lot going on that was not taught. Documentation is scarce and googled resources are extremely vague or direct to particular projects and implementations. I am also not fond of projects in a learning environment that have you bouncing between repos to and fro. Unless everything goes as planned and no bugs are encountered this sprint takes much longer than the time alotted.

1. Configuring something like Whitenoise was a hang up even with the documentation which again as stated above is vague.

2. A Sprint challenge spread between multiple repos is confusing and daunting.

3. The lack of instruction on deployment is upsetting, and answers to common questions do not often solve deployment bugs as each answer is often directly related to the implementation referred to in the question.

4. I would like to see more time spent on deployment and bugs surrounding deployment. Each sprint for deployment has been complicated and with little to no instruction on arguably one of the more technical portions of app building. I enjoy running through the gambit of bugs associated with this and figuring things out, but instruction on the subject would be appreciated more than struggling for 3 hours with bug after bug.
