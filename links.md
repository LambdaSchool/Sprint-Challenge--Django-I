There's two projects. 
First: django_first (my version of djorg) is not
working. I used it to go through the process once, but had to overwrite
some files when creating the second project.
Seconod: deliverables. This is what I later did on my own in a second pass,
and what I deployed. manage.py and other files from this project overwrote
files from the first django_first project.
