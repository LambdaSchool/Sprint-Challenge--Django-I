My attempt at deployment was a little rough at times today. I don't understand what the majority of the steps in the readme were really doing. Django is a huge confusing mess of things that involves a lot of googling for me.

While trying to deploy, I spent a lot of time making small changes to settings.py and Procfile. It also took a few tries to get the environment variables on heroku right. Finally, I got a build to succeed and was able to view the /api screen after reloading the Procfile a few times.

I have the app working as of right now! I'm sure there are things that could be improved but overall it was a success.
