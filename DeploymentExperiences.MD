For me, deploying to Heroku today was a smooth and easy process (much more so than backend project week). I already have a Heroku account and had the CLI installed, so I started by logging into heroku through my terminal and installing dependencies. That went smoothly as I simply followed the instructions in the Readme, which is also true of most of the steps.  The only thing that was tricky was working on the settings.py file, particularly adding corsheaders, ALLOWED_HOSTS and DATABASES. But Braden Walker went over this part in standup yesterday, so I already knew what to do ahead of time, it just took a while to read the documentation and make sure syntax was correct. I opted to set the config variables for heroku through the dashboard on their website, as I'm quite comfortable navigating their dashboard. I then pushed to Heroku and created a super user to test functionality. I created an admin user and made two todo tasks (one personal) with their account. All functionality appears to still work after deployment.
