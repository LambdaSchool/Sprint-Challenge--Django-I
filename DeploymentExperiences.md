I had a few issues with deployment. Mainly with the static files configuration. After a few StackOverflow attempts I found a great [Heroku resource] (https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/django-assets) that helped deploy my application. However, once my application was deployed I ran into a few more issues that I was able to debug using `heroku logs`.
