The readme for the sprint made deplying this really easy.
I had just a couple hiccups.

1.  I had to change the ALLOWED_HOSTS in the settings.py not just on Heroku.
2.  I changed the base route to the bookmarks page
3.  Change the redirect to match the base route after adding a bookmark

after those changes, everything was successfully deployed
