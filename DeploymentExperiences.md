Deployment was a difficult process. I started by following the guide as closely as possible. When I finished the steps and attempted to deploy, I ran into issues with Whitenoise static rules not being followed. I searched online and found a stack overflow question that addressed my problem. Afterwards, the site was deployed, but I was unable to create a superuser. I determined that the issue was with heroku using the wrong database. It was using sqlite in deployment mode, instead of using the postgres database I made for it. I am still in the process of troubleshooting this issue. I can see the /admin page on my heroku app, but I cannot login because there is no admin user.
