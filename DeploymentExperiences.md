I got it up and working on Heroku.

This was pretty difficult.  I spent most of the week figuring out how to fix errors, even going so far as to
reinstall Windows 10.  Which did fix some issues, that I believe were left over from uninstalling software 
that I was using before Lambda School, but I cannot confirm that.  However, all this bug fixing limited my time
to be able to go and do any Python/Django tutorials outside of Lambda, which seems to be what everybody else
was doing.  Made today rather difficult, but I did get it working on Heroku, and verified by making accounts,
posting a Note, and posting Personal Notes for both admin and general user, then pulled them up using the api
view.

The hardest part was that there was no straight forward documentation for getting it done.  It took a bit of
looking around, and hopping through different pages to get it pieced together.

tldr:
- Lots of bug fixing through the week = limited tutorial time
- Poor documentation for python in general = confusing implementation
- Project is MVP complete.
