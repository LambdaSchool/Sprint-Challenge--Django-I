My deployment experience with Heroku went much better than the last time I tried with JavaScript. File structures, procfile, .env file, etc. make much more sense than the first time. It deployed successfully, home page and admin page work, but some issues between Python and PostgreSQL with variables prevent my data from showing and ran out of time to figure out the cause. Using too many imports caused some initial confusion with getting them all straight and ensuring Heroku had everything it needed to deploy correctly. Overall, I would consider this a success because I made more progress than last time and the initial page rendered. My next goal will be to have an app work at one-hundred percent.
