Today, the process of deploying to Heroku went pretty well. I went through the first 10 steps line by line and followed the directions carefully. I already had a Heroku account and had installed the Heroku CLI previously. I had an issue with the Heroku deploy initially, in reference to the `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` config variable, which I had to enable.

Then I got stuck for a long time on trying to migrate the Postgres server hosted on Heroku. I had to Google quite a bit to come up with the method of solving it, by altering the DATABASES setting in settings.py. I was finally able to migrate. Then I tried to open the app and on every endpoint, the server showed a 500 error. I turned DEBUG to True and troubleshooted from there. That led me to add another two lines to the settings.py that referenced static files. Now it is all up and running well. This has been a great experience for me, increasing my understanding of deploying back ends. I also created two superusers and added films to each user's Personal Films list.
