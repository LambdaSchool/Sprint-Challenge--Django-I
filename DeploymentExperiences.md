The deployment experience was ok over all, I had issues with figuring out how to set up ALLOWED_HOSTS and DATABASE_URL in settings.py but figured that out. I came up with an H10 error in the end indicating that perhaps my environment was not set up properly. 

Other than this, I think I finished key aspects of the deployment process.
