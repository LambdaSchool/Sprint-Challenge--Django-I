## Honestly I have always struggled a bit with deployment. Especially deploying different DB's is always a little hard for me. Some things that went well:

 - Heroku CLI tools installed very nicely using the ubuntu installation in the documentation
 - The guide to deploying was actually pretty helpful as well and I appreciated the links to documentation.
 - Seemed to be easy gettiung the project created using the Heroki CLI interface and connected to my repository.
 

## What went poorly:

 - Unbale to run migrations on heroku app and keeps failing
 - Structure of my app I beleive is throwing off heroku
 - If I grasped what was happening in the Djorg app a little better I might be able to solve the issue.


## Left to do:

 - App is not running and failing to build on heroku. Need to implement.
 - Need to pay close attention to the solution lecture and try to emulate deployment step by step.
 - 
 

## All in all a very interesting experience and something I have not done with a django project before. Going to take some time and perhaps try to emulate it with docker since I'm familiar with that process.
