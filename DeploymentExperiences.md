If you want to test it posting to the endpoint /api/users/ with a username and password (those are the field names) will make you an account. 

I'm not quite sure what to write as a summery. Most of this project was like legos, one step after another and you got a finished piece. I had no enviroment issues, or at least none I couldn't correct.
I did add the ability to add users, that was a bit tricky and required a bit more understanding of what was going on. 
Deployment I messed up the static files thing because I wasn't sure what it was but realized my mistake when I saw no CSS.
I can't say I'm the biggest fan of Django. While it's true that it does allow some pretty high quality endpoints I almost would feel better about making it with express especially if I could find a library that served a similar function.
