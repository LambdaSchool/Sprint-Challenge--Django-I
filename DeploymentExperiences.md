Wow. What an experience. I had so much trouble getting this app deployed, but somehow, it finally works. I am kind of shocked to be frank. After the initial errors of getting it deployed in the first place, I kept getting an h10 error when trying to open it, which is just about as vague as possible. I had to make many, many, many changes to settings and the Procfile. More than 10 times each. I googled my heart out, and changed little bits and pieces of code for eternity. The static setting was especially troublesome, and I had to redo it a couple times. I also had to mess with base directory, and allowed hosts. Google had said to set it to *, but heroku as the readme stated was the correct way to go. I am honestly not sure if my code is 100% correct anymore... I just know it works, and I'm pretty happy with that given this was such a hard and crazy experience.
