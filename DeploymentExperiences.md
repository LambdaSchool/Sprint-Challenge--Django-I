- Summarize the key steps in the deployment process. 
        Make an account or sign in to Heroku and install the CLI. Make sure you have all of the correct dependencies installed. MAke sure everything that needs to be hidden in .env, is infact there and spelled correctly XD. Check you databse urls and allowed host, whihc should be set to heroku. Change your secret key. Make a Procfile, whihc will tell heroku what to run to start your app. Configure whitenoise. heroku create you-app, and then heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev. Then deploy....or that should work in theory..XD
  - What went well?
        my dependencies installed with no problems.
  - What challenges did you face?
        "...SECRET_KEY not found."
  - How far did you get?
        To step 9. I think is where things are not going well.
- We have utilized docs from several different projects over the course of this Sprint.
  - Which docs did you think were the most helpful? 
        the signup link for Heroku, and the Heroku CLI link.
  - Name one or two specific things about this resource that you think sets it apart from other docs you have referenced in the past. 
        It was crystal clear what I needed to do.

    Step 6.vi was very confusing for me. Are we suppose to use all three? Which url? It was left very open ended and there were a lot of different options. I ultimately just picked one, no url and hoped and prayed it worked.
