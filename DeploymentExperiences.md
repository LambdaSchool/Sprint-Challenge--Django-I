*   The feeling was definitely unique to anything i've felt before. The slow wait as heroku installs all the packages just hoping it throws no errors. However, of course there were errors so then finding and fixing the erros before trying to deploy again. Then when it finally deployed but couldnt run the commandline `heroku run python manage.py migrate` T_T. Then i had to figure out what i couldnt use manage.py to issue commands... 

*   Trying out some changes to fix that only to figure out some of the changes i did like `heroku config:unset ALLOWEDHOSTS` in order to remake it as `heroku config:set settings.ALLOWED_HOSTS=.herokuapp.com` now had to be undone becuase i initially had it right and that wasn't a necessary change T_T. When i finally was able to make my migrations and then runserver without any issue, all i felt was a pretty good feeling of satisfaction.
