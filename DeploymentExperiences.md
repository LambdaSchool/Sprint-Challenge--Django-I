- Summarize the key steps in the deployment process. 
  - What went well?
  
  The whole process was fairly  straightforward. I didn't have too much difficulties in doing it.
  
  - What challenges did you face? 
  
  The biggest blocker that I had was ALLOWED_HOSTS, but after some fiddling around I eventually got it
  working. 404 Bad Request
  
  - How far did you get?
  
  I completed the MVP, got it deployed and was able to view admin, create notes, etc via heroku
  
- We have utilized docs from several different projects over the course of this Sprint.
  - Which docs did you think were the most helpful? 
  
  Heroku docs was helpful, as I am running Fedora, there isn't a release (.rpm package) for
  Fedora, so I had to do the standalone install to get the CLI working. The docs had a straightforward
  instructions. As well as the docs for dj-database-url had some good documentation to getting it setup.
  
  - Name one or two specific things about this resource that you think sets it apart from other docs you have referenced in the past. 
  
  Hmm, for Heroku, the variations in instructions for the different Linux distro's helped. Not many
  programs go into detail about the different systems it can run on and how to initially get them
  working, for the tar files to be exact. As for dj-database-url It gives various usages and schemas that
  you can use for the various databases
