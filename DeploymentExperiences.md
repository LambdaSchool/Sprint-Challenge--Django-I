I had no problem at all deploying my back-end project week app to heroku, so I expected this to be a breeze, but it proved to be much more
difficult than I thought. I followed the instructions carefully and was able to successfully deploy, but the got an 'Application Error'
when I tried to view my page. I believe that my issuse has something to do with the ALLOWED_HOSTS enviroment variable and the configuring 
of dj_database_urls. These issues were extremely difficult to troubleshoot becuase I lack a fundamental understanding of how Django works
and what we were trying to do with it. I'm still very confused aobut where the actual database is hosted and how it connects to our 
application. This weekend I plan to start over with Django and see if I can gain a better understanding of how it works.
