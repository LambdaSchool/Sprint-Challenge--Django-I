### Main Errors:
- readme from day 3 included backticks from self.context[‘request’].user should be self.context['request'].user
- issues with using whitenoise at first had to make sure I pointed to staticfiles

I feel like this week could have been improved in the future by providing a clean image or a docker instance with python configured to avoid silly issues like Path errors.

It would have been more prudent to ask us to document these issues issues during the week.

Config Vars needed to point to the appropriate url
.herokuapp.com

Issues hitting a bad  request during deployment, fixed by pointing to correct url.
