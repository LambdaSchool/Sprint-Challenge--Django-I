  - What went well?

  - What challenges did you face?
  I was needed to completely uninstall some packages and to install it again. At some point completely deleted the project and built it from scratch to make it work.
  Was looking for solutions on internet to resolve issues I had with django and deployment, not always worked for me... 
  - How far did you get?
  I have functional django link on my local machine and functional heroku online link.
