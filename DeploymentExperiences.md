- INITIAL COMMIT, ARE YOU READY TO ROCK!?

- Summarize the key steps in the deployment process. 
  - What went well?
  At first it was fine, but after trying to deploy on Heroku, nothing was running correctly. Dependencies and pipfiles was not updating correctly, and therefore kept failing deployment. The second time around it worked, but it kept giving me a 400 error. 

  After adding some new parameters to ALLOWED_HOSTS the whole thing deployed and it allowed me access to the admin site page.

  - What challenges did you face?
  My dependecies were all jambled up, so I had re-do all of Intro-Django and make sure all dependcies were updated and correct and that my pipfile was updating.

  - How far did you get?
  I have it deployed, and I can access the admin page/ api in Herku app. So I have completed the MVP.

- We have utilized docs from several different projects over the course of this Sprint.
  - Which docs did you think were the most helpful? 
  I referenced the old Intro-Python docs A LOT and also the back-end server project docs. We deployed them on Heroku before so I needed to refresh my mind on commands.

  But the docs for DATABASES and whitenoise were confusing at first, but I eventually clarified them and then everything made more sense.

  - Name one or two specific things about this resource that you think sets it apart from other docs you have referenced in the past. 

  This gave you the answer but didn't. We had the boilerplate for how the syntax was set, but we had to customize configurations for whitenoise specific to out programming language.

  I guess it's no different from other docs that gave us methods with parameters that we just plug in with our own work. Now that I think about it. I don't necessarily understand the question.
