- Summarize the key steps in the deployment process.
  - What went well?

  # Initial set up.

  - What challenges did you face?

  # I thought the instructions were unclear about *how* to deploy the Intro-Django app.
  It was not intuitive that forking the Sprint project also meant working out of Intro-Django.

  # Static settings had to be disabled.

  # Project could/can not find `corsheaders` despite the module existing in both projects
  (not intuitive to install what isn't in the project, assuming this is true)

  # Matching the `DATABASE_URL` in both projects

  - How far did you get?

  # Deployed on Heroku

- We have utilized docs from several different projects over the course of this Sprint.
  - Which docs did you think were the most helpful?

  # Heroku's documentation was the best

  - Name one or two specific things about this resource that you think sets it apart from other docs you have referenced in the past.

  # Very straightforward. The goal is to get up and running!
