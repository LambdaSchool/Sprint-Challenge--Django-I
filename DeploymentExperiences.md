### Deployment Experience ###
I have been deploying software solutions for a while. From the great XAMPP for windows to AWS and Rackspace cloud services, spinning up a server, setting up a web host, and deploying to remote systems has been something Ive specialized in for a few years now. I have used Apache for quite a few years now, creating Virtual hosts and setting up applications as a service. 

I didn't quite get to the Heruko, that will come tonight. Ill update with a link here...

and more details about that adventure.
