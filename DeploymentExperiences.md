Deployment was a difficult process. I started by following the guide as closely as possible. When I finished the steps and attempted to deploy, I ran into issues with Whitenoise static rules not being followed. I searched online and found a stack overflow question that addressed my problem. 

Afterwards, the site was deployed, but I was unable to create a superuser. I determined that the issue was with heroku using the wrong database. It was using sqlite in deployment mode, instead of using the postgres database I made for it. I determined that the issue was I had 2 different assignments to the DATABASE variable in the file, the one I added at the top of the file and the one that was there previously. The previous one was called last and so was constantly overriding my newer version. 

After I fixed that, I was able to generate a superuser and log in to the admin account. I attempted to generate and save a new note, but I received a 500 response from the server. To see more details about the error, I temporarily switched the heroku config variable for Debug to True then recreated the error. The error stated that my notes_note table did not exist. This led me to investigate my migration files. In an earlier attempt at debugging, I deleted my migration folders to force a remigration. A general migrate didn't fix the issue so I had to migrate each app independently in my local file, push the changes to heroku, and then migrate them on the heroku side. This fixed the issue and my deployment is complete.
