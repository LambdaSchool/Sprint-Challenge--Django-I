## The deployment process went alright, hit a few hiccups in the development process so the deployment will be on hold for now

#### What went well?
- The instructions were clear, Heroku tools had no problems installing, and the documentation was easy to read

#### What went poorly?
- Hiccup on migrations
- Djorg is still being completed

#### To do:
- Complete Djorg, finish deployment

## It was nice to dive into Python and deployment for Django all within a week, I will be revisiting this to get a better grasp on the syntax and functions.
