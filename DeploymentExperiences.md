# Summarizing how the process went for you, what went well and what was tricky, and how far you got

1. Install new dependencies 
2. Set up .env
3. Modify setting.py 
    - It was most tricky part. I googled a lot and tried many different way, finaly it runs well. The main problem was set up config and migrations on Heroku. 
4. I want to change the deployment method from Heroku Git to my GitHub account, because I cannot submit my original repo with final version.
