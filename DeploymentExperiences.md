I have a decent amount of experience with simple Heroku deployments, so nothing specifically about that got me.  However, I ran into a few rough patches when it came to figuring out what was going wrong when it deployed fine but always returned an HTTP status 400.  It turns out that was due to a misconfigured ALLOWED_HOSTS variable and the program was unable to connect to the Postgres Database because of some url parsing error. To fix those I wrote them in manually.
