The process went very well. I didn't need to reference much material to work with Django and Python. Heruko was almost a new process and required documentation. I was able to get the site running on Heroku, but no improvements were made to how it looks. The most difficult aspect today was a module not found error when migrating to Heroku. Somehow decouple wasn't pushed up to Heroku and only existed locally. Heroku logs made this clear.
