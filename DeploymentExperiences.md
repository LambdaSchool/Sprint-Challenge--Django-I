The project that I was set to deploy went much smoother than the actual deployment. I was working on the deployment late at night after helping a lot of people with the intro project. Combined with it being my first time doing a deployment this way I made a lot of errors. Primarily I wasn't installing the packages in my root folder, I had procfile lowercase, requirements.txt was uppercase, and where I imported the database I pluralised it. However, I got it all working early in the week so I can feel good about that.

Looking at the django heroku example deployment was most helpful for me. It solidified what I had done right, and by comparison let me know what was wrong. I think the fact that their example literally is a whole project that you can deploy and compare your code to is incredibly helpeful. That is what I would say sets it most apart from other documentation. My project can be seen below.
