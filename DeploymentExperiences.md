Deployment for me went well. I was able to get my app configured and compiled correctly. I had some initial issues with Cors not being found in the project which was keeping things from deploying.

Once I was able to remove cors and do some debugging I was able to depoly the app. It was definitely exciting to successfully deploy the app. I can't wait to do it again during labs!
