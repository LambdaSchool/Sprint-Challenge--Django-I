The process was pretty tedious at first, but all I have to do was rewatch the lectures and quickly let all the information resonate; it just clicked after a few minutes and I went ahead and ventured through with the assignment. The only problem I ran into that was quickly remedied was running the collectstatic feature in the heroku dyno; the fix for this however, was fairly simple as it only required me to tweak DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC to equal 1 and then migrate the database afterwards.
