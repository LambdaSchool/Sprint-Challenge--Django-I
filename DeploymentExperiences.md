- Summarize the key steps in the deployment process. 
  - What went well?
    I did not give up.
    I understand what Django is doing--it's allowing us to write code in Python
    and then translating that code into SQL under the hood.
  - What challenges did you face? 
    I'm not sure whether or not to copy my notes directory from the Intro-Django project or not.
    I struggle under pressure. The clock is ticking and laughing in my face. I'm getting import errors
    I'm relying very heavily on the configurations and settings in the Intro-Django repo, for which I have 
    completed days 1 - 3 and have partially completed day 4.

  - How far did you get?
  - I am still trying to deploy the app.
- We have utilized docs from several different projects over the course of this Sprint.
  - Which docs did you think were the most helpful? 
    The docs are rough to me, as always. I still don't find any of them super helpful but
    that is very slowly changing as I just keep hacking away at it.
  - Name one or two specific things about this resource that you think sets it apart from other docs you have referenced in the past. 
    The README.md was the most intelligible thing in this assignment. The docs are the docs, and they don't
    like me, but I keep reading them anyways.
