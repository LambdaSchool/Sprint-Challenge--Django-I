Deploying my django app was fairly painless. The steps outlined in the
readme were very descriptive and I was able to follow along easily enough. Like everything, I did have to add some extra stuff that were not mentioned but researching was very rewarding and after some errors deploying I was able to deploy.

Right now my app has been deployed but I am still getting an error that I
am currently investigating but I do have some promising clues. Overall, I enjoyed this sprint challenge as with all sprints I am able to get through. And while deployment is still somewhat new to me, I now know where and what to look for in the future.
