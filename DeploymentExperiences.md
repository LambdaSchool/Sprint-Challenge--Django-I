#    This is the second app I ever deployed and my first Django app, so I went through the process very slowly and methodically. Aside from some normal hiccups while deciphering the docs, it went fairly smooth. Just real slow. However, although the app deployed successfully, I am currently getting a 503 error so I obviously need to bebug that.
