Experiences: I t was kinda fun. I messed up by deleting the original app and trying to re-commit the changes. Heroku kept trying to save to the original, generic app name. Figuring out it was just `git`, I just changed the remote as you would with any other git repo :man_shrugging:... Everything is running!
