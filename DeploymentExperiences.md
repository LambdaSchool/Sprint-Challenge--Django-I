# Deployment Experience

My second web app deployment experience was easier than the first. One of the more tricky parts was making sure the right environment variables are set up in Heroku prior to pushing to Heroku. After pushing to Heroku, I initially thought my database was all set, however, I needed to migrate the Heroku database and create a new superuser in order to access the admin.
