The process to get the project on github was easy when I followed the instructions. Right now it's not possible to log in however because I didn't import the database correctly, so the only functional part of the app is the Japanese dictionary viewer. Most of my time was spent figuring out how to port my regex operations from nodejs to python, and how to do an http request using django, which I did by importing this library: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/
