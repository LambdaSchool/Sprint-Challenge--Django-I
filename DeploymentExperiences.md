Summary:

- Summarize the key steps in the deployment process. 
  - What went well?
  	The instructions were pretty clear. Everything was new and is still new though, so I had to go through it slowly. Debug to deploy didn't take as long as I expected and my interpretations of the more vague instructions worked out!

  - What challenges did you face?
  	Understanding what I was doing was the biggest challenge. Under time pressure, the focus is on getting a working MVP. Now that I'm done, I'd like to go through the steps again and try to understand each step. For me, understanding why something is done is key for me to learn and remember it.

  	Getting used to reading the errors in the Terminal was also challenging since it's a different format and less readable to me.

  - How far did you get?
  	I deployed the app on heroku and everything is working as it did pre production.

- We have utilized docs from several different projects over the course of this Sprint.
  - Which docs did you think were the most helpful? 
  The Django documentation itself was helpful. I also found it helpful to look up documentation for modules that were imported in various parts of the project even though it wasn't provided. That was helpful in understanding some parts that were not explained in detail.

  - Name one or two specific things about this resource that you think sets it apart from other docs you have referenced in the past. 
  Funny enough, documentation are built without the user experience in mind. It makes it harder to read and understand when someone is first exposed to it. The Django documentation is very well layed out and specific enough to the possible user types looking at the documentation. Some parts still require further research but overall it's great.
