* The keys steps in the deployment process were to:
        1.) Install relavent packages
        2.) Configure packages
        3.) Create requirements.txt file
        4.) Create Procfile
        5.) Run Heroku commands to create and deploy
        6.) Configure Heroku Environment

* Installing packages went well. Forgot you have to commit changes so was stuck for a while. I got the app deployed and migrated changes to postgres database.  

- We have utilized docs from several different projects over the course of this Sprint.
  - Which docs did you think were the most helpful? 
  - Name one or two specific things about this resource that you think sets it apart from other docs you have referenced in the past.

  * The Heroku "Gettting Started with Python" doc was the most helpful to me I referred to it throughout the entire process.  Its very detailed and has good examples.
