- Summarize the key steps in the deployment process. 

  - What went well?
    finished the sprint.

  - What challenges did you face?
    Not having the confidence to fully understand what the sprint was asking of me
    I felt like some of the direction were slightly confusing and this seemed to simple
    which scared me.

  - How far did you get?
    deployed my project.

- We have utilized docs from several different projects over the course of this Sprint.
  - Which docs did you think were the most helpful? 
    the ones provided by Lambda, and a little bit of youtube.

  - Name one or two specific things about this resource that you think sets it apart     from other docs you have referenced in the past. 
    It baby stepped up which we don't get too often and because of that the 
    unfamiler help and stress free feeling can be slightly scary since we are not
    used to that.
