After completing an application, deployment is the next step in order to make the work visible to others. In this Sprint Challenge, I was able to go through a step by step tutorial to deploy my first Python/Django application. The steps included installing multiple dependencies, configuring the settings.py, and additional changes to Heroku like adding configuration variables and creating a PostgreSQL database. The biggest snag on the way was having my Heroku commandline freeze after usage, the solution was to update my Heroku version and remove a 'netrc' file.
