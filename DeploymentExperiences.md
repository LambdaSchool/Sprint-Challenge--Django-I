Following is a list of my deployment experiences:
* Had no problems installing dependencies or preparing the project for deployment
* First deployment attempt results in Collectstatic error. I tired to #comment out the line throwing the error from settings.py, tried to re-deploy, but got the same error.
* After googling the error I found that the solution was to temporarily disable collectstatic during the deploy
* DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL!
* Next I tried running migrations and got a syntax error, just a closing parantheses was missing in settings.py - easy fix.
* Again, an error while running migrations SECRET_KEY not found. Added SECRET_KEY to config cars in the heroku dashboard and now everything works!
* Having an issue with the deployed site "server unavailable"
