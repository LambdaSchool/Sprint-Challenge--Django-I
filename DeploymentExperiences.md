Although I consider myself to be good with deployment, I ran into some issues this morning. I was able to deploy the app pretty quickly, but I ran into some issues with the app crashing. However, I think if I was able to deploy the app without any issues initially, I wouldn't have learned as much. It forced me to search for and read lots of documentation regarding deploying a Django app to Heroku. As of writing this, I'm still working out some bugs in the heroku logs to keep the app from crashing.
