- Summarize the key steps in the deployment process.
  - What went well?
    I got it to work! I had little problems following the documentation (been getting much better at it)
    and it loads. It was a great way to get more comfortable with Heroku. Most of the process was pretty smooth,
    and the documentation for using the CLI was very clear. It was fun learning to do everything from the terminal.
  - What challenges did you face?
    I had nested project files. I'd started a new project called Deliverables next to the original djorg project.
    In order to avoid overwriting manage.py and other files, I nested it. When it became time to add a Procfile,
    the  structure broke everything and nothing would run. It took me about an hour, but restructuring and overwriting
    some folders correctly managed to solve the problem.
  - How far did you get?
    Finished :) but no stretches
- We have utilized docs from several different projects over the course of this Sprint.
  - Which docs did you think were the most helpful?
    In this particular case, Heroku's documentation proved to be the most useful. The deployment part proved
    to be the hardest to solve. Heroku has obviously spent a lot of time finding bugs and errors in their process,
    and have come up with great documentation to address each specific issue.
  - Name one or two specific things about this resource that you think sets it apart from other docs you have referenced in the past.
    Common errors: I don't recall seeing such a specific and targeted document for errors. Other docs have possible
    pit falls, but Heroku has an extensive directory of the error codes and their solutions.
