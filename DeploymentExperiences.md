Signing up and installing for Heroku went smoothly. I was able to login successfully and install the required dependencies. I copied over the 'dotenv' file into my '.env' file for my project. I followed the instructions for creating a new secret key. I loaded the database url and passed it to the dj database config. I created a procfile and configured whitenoise. I added static settings and created my heroku app. I made a postgresql database associated with the project and set the heroku config variables. I was not able to deploy due to a disalloewd host error.
