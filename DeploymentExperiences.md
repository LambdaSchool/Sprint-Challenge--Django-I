### Experience Deploying First Django App

I found this to be very frustrating, to be completely honest. I think it is beneficial to learn, but a pretty inaccurate test of whether we have grasped the Python and Django material we have studied this week. This doesn't feel like a Sprint Challenge at all.

We didn't go over configuring a Database in our settings.py file, as that was already done for us in our starter code this week, but appears to be the primary reason for Deployment failures and errors in the chat today---it is certainly one that I am facing. I don't feel that the course material prepared me at all for this. We didn't talk about it at all, so I feel a bit like a student who studied the assigned chapter, only to find the test is on another topic completely.

I enjoyed the material this week, probably more than most other topics we have discussed. I love working with Python, I'm really liking Django so far, and I love working with DBs. I don't have a lot of experience, but I really like learning more about them. So feeling like I do now is not fun. I feel like I don't have a grasp on how to configure a DB at all in any way that is beneficial. Practicing migrations did not prepare me for this.

I had the front page up and running, but then bookmarks was throwing errors. But then I saw that my db wasn't configured properly at all. I thought I fixed it. But now I'm getting a 500 and not connecting at all. It feels like I just took two huge steps backwards.
