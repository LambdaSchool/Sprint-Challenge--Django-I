# Deployment Experiences
The deployment process went relatively smoothly, even though there were a few issues along the way. I was able to get the app deployed within the time alotted and it seems to work as in my development environment.

    - *What was tricky:* Keeping track of all the various things that happen under the hood and what parts are specific to which area (i.e. Django-specific vs Heroku-specific stuff). There were also quite a few new packages that I wasn't familiar with and keeping track of the documentation and knowing what to look for when debugging was definitely a little challenging.

    - *What went well:* I was able to figure out the issues that I encountered relatively quickly, even though most of the stack is still pretty new to me. Even though I haven't known Python for very long, I didn't find my relative unfamiliarity of the language to be a barrier.
