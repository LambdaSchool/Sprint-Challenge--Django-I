The deploymemnt experience was bit frustrating. The instructions though are very helpful with the links provided. The hardest parts were configuring how to use the database url properply and the whitenoise config as well. After much time searching for answers to those problems in google, I was able to to deploy and get an api/notes response and a .admin login page as well that works, with the super user that I created using heroku. Although when I hit open app I get an error of url not found. I will have to research more that error and get the app displaying correctly.
