Deploying was not very difficult. I felt the instructions were straightforward. The hardest parts were the ALLOWED HOSTS variable. I had read that this was pretty much a string of three different things. I still placed into the config without splitting it up. I later learned that splitting it would be required and it made sense. I didn't think of doing this initially.  

Overall it was a success, and I have the app deployed, and I was able to create a new user and log in to the application. The STATIC_ROOT variable for some unknown reason I initially left out of my settings.py file. I added that variable in later. So I would add that difficulty in deploying was that my eyes at times moved passed a line and unto the next line. During the project creation, I had to write things out to remember which step I had just performed to keep from missing steps.
