Overall the week went pretty smoothly for me, I was able to follow along and even get Bookmarks launched on the local server. The most difficult part for me would have to be trying to deploy my server. I feel like I am almost done with the whole process but am getting an Application error whenever I go to my heroku.app. Hopefully this will change soon!
