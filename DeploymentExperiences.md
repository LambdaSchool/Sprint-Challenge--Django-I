# Summarizing how the process went for you, what went well and what was tricky, and how far you got

1. Install new dependencies 
    - Even though I installed all the dependencies, VS code pilint showed me 'unablie to import decouple'. I don't know how to fix this lint error.

2. Set up .env
    - I forgot how to open the Python shell to generate the SECRET_KEY at the first time, but figured it out.

3. Modify setting.py 
    - It was most tricky part. I googled a lot and tried many different way, finaly it runs well. The main problem was set up config and migrations on Heroku. 
    - Many errors from DBs. It mostly fixed after migration on Heroku.
