1. I have no previous experience with heroku so I was unsuccessful in getting my django app deployed. I kept having application errors that prevented me from deploying at first. Then once I feel like I solved those issues I was getting an improperly configured error and I was unable to solve the issues with the path. Very very frustrating overall and I think a lot of that has to do with my inexperience with both Django and Heroku. I will continue to work on it and hopefully solve the static url path issues.
