#### Deployment Experiences:

This project deployment was a great experience. I set a timer to see if I can complete the deployment process under that pressure.
I have to say that I did pretty good on that.

I've seen many error during this deployement.
Some of them are:
1. ModuleNotFoundError
2. Problems related to implementing *static* files

To see all those errors going away was very fun.
There comes the next problem, an *application error* without the 
proper error on page. But using **heroku logs** helped me to debug
the rest the errors.

Overall, I had a very good experience debugging and Django deployment as a whole. I understand there is more to Django deployment than I have seen today.
