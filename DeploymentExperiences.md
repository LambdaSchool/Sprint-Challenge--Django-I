The process began very straightforward and smooth for the most part. There was a hiccup in figuring out how to set up the config with the enviroment variables which was solved by thoroughly reading documentation and stack overflow. The build failed to deploy due to the fact that I invoked the DATABASES dictionary in a line before it was created. I also ran into the problem that I needed to install corsheader into my root folder in order for the the heroku deployment to continue. All in all a very useful exercise in looking up documentation and using it to debug code.
