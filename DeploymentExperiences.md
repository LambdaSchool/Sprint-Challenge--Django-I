* [x] - A `DeploymentExperiences.md` file where you write summarizing how the process went for you, what went well and what was tricky, and how far you got

1. I accidentally deleted my repo through a command I tried to use, I could not find it in the trash and even when I took it from the repo, .env was missing. I learned how to change SECRET_KEY, makemigrations again, etc.

2. Heroku deployment can get tricky. Installing dependencies and changing files to use them can get you in a loophole if you're not aware of how to go about things. 

3. I was able to deploy my app but my database isn't showing on the heroku app. My links are not linking to the local page. Bootstrap isn't complete.
