- Summarize the key steps in the deployment process. 
  - What went well? It's pretty straightforward, just follow the directions.
  - What challenges did you face? I read on of the instructions wrong and was trying to import something from something else when I needed to just import the module itself 
  - How far did you get? I have deployed live.
- We have utilized docs from several different projects over the course of this Sprint.
  - Which docs did you think were the most helpful? Hard to say, the doc that have been compiled by Lambda in out project.
  - Name one or two specific things about this resource that you think sets it apart from other docs you have referenced in the past. The instructions made for day1-4 are concise and references other docs for more detailed information. What's better than a direct how to Django?
