# Deployment Experiences

As this was not the first time deploying to heroku it went pretty seemlessly. 
I really like that they are offering postgres instances for free use, it integrates
very cleanly with the Django-backend (as I guess does everything with an ORM that 
high level).

However it was the first time I've used the heroku cli, which worked great 
right out of the box. Awesome tool!
