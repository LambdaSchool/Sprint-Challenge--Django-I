As expecteded I struggled through this challenge. Heroku has always been a challenge for me and today was no different. Unfortunately, I didn't do myself any favors by deciding to scrap my original project and start fresh last night. I spent most of the night working on a new weekly project and just burnt myself out before it came time for the sprint. I'm going to keep plugging away at this though, it's important to me to find the solution myself rather than have someone show it to me. I know thats not really keeping in faith of the twenty minute rule but I think I will learn the material better that way.
