- Summarize the key steps in the deployment process. 

  - What went well?
  
  I completed the deployment, which was most important. As far as the process to get there, the installation of Heroku and the setup was very straightforward, and it was a good exercie to understand the importance and use of the .env file. 

  - What challenges did you face? 

  The hardest part of the process was re-factoring my settings, especially the ALLOWED_HOSTS, which required use of config() and DATABASES, which required use of dj_database_url.config(), libraries and methods I had not used before. Additionaly, I had a slight hiccup at the end when I thought my app was not available at the url, but it turned out that I could navigate to /admin, I just didn't have a landing page/front end set up so at first it seemed like the app wasn't deployed at all.

  - How far did you get?

  I completed deployment and was able to access the admin route for my app.

- We have utilized docs from several different projects over the course of this Sprint.

  - Which docs did you think were the most helpful? 

  The most helpful docs, throughout the week and today, were the instructions provided in the project README files. 

  Specificaly related to the Sprint Challenge and deployment, the Heroku documentaion was quite good. 

  - Name one or two specific things about this resource that you think sets it apart from other docs you have referenced in the past. 

  The project instructions were incredibly detailed and allowed me to complete a lot of steps that would have taken considerably more time to research and understand. Not all assignments require such detail but it was particularly important this week because there were so many specific steps to complete in the correct order. On multiple occasions I ran into problems and was able to go back to an earlier part of the instructions and very quickly find where I made a mistake or skipped a step.

  The Heroku docs had detailed but clear explanations, and showed multiple ways to do things when available.
