***Deployment Steps***
To Deploy to heroku I did the following:
* Sign up
* Install
* login
* installed dependencies
* prepped my project (debugged, cleaned up, added enviroment variables)
* created app on heroku
* and finally Deployed it!

** just a note if you have to change .env variables you can push them up with `heroku config:set whatever_changed`
