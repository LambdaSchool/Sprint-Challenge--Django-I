My process with deploying my Django app was a little tricky. I had to make sure I read several steps ahead so I made sure to know where I was going. Everything went well I was able to deploy after a few hiccups. Challanges that I faced were being able to get my app deployed. I was having issues with my secret key and it turns out it had something to do with COLLECTSTATIC. This link was a big help https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36665889/collectstatic-error-while-deploying-django-app-to-heroku. I completed today's MVP, my only issue was being able to login and create a superuser. This hinders me from adding or seeing notes, but the site/routes are running correctly. I just followed the readme and the link that helped with the collectstatic issues. This resource was detailed in that it gave specfic instructions leaving little room for error.
