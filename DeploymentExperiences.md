October 25th 2018 was the day I deployed my Intro-Django project to heroku.Deploying a project to heroku
can be a challenging but rewarding process, and I feel must be completed slowly with deep concentration.
I followed each given step in the repository and have collaborated the deployment process with my pair
programming partner.During the process I have encountered two errors that have caused a delay in my deployment
and migrations.

With the first error , I had to do a heroku-django download and a couple of imports with the assistance from
three project managers and my section lead. This first error was solved with a couple of git pushes, imports and an installation. My second error involved not being able to make migrations with heroku , and I have recieved assistance with this from two project managers and my pair programming partner. We have come to the conclusion that changes needed to be made with my database section in my settings.py along with pushing to github and adding a DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC to my configvars. The changes have been successful and that completed the sprint challenge.
