file where you write summarizing how the process went for you, what went well and what was tricky, and how far you got

For the writing portion, this is meant to practice your skills at
*professional* writing - in the tech world, that means writing things clearly,
concisely, in a way to get the information across efficiently to an audience
that may be pretty busy (most people only skim most emails). Suggested length
~1-2 paragraphs, and bullet lists can be extremely effective.

## Deployment Experience

My second web app deployment experience was easier than the first. One of the more tricky parts was making sure the right environment variables are set up in Heroku prior to pushing to Heroku. After pushing to Heroku, I initially thought my database was all set, however, I needed to migrate the Heroku database and create a new superuser in order to access the admin.
