## Experiences when deploying to heroku

* It was mostly straight forward.  I did came into some problems though.  One of the problem was that my pipfile.lock is outdated and so I have to update it before install some of the packages.  Some of the docs where straight forward but some were a bit tougher.  I had Ja helping me because she has a reference from https://github.com/lambdaschool-pm/django-review which helps a lot.  Overall it was good got everything to work fine and learn more about reading documentations.
