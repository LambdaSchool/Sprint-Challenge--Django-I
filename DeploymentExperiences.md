# Heroku Deployment Experience

I was able to deploy with few issues. The directions for the assignment were extremely clear and helpful. Issues I _did_ encounter related to properly configuring `settings.py` to work with my `.env` file. In addition to some stumbles with configuration, I forgot to run migrations on Heroku. All in all my deployment experience went well, and the fact that deploying to a service like Heroku is such a common task made _googling_ for the correct information painless.
