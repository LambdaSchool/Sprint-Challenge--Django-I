Project repo: https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Intro-Django/pull/117

Heroku site: https://jennifer-player-djorg.herokuapp.com

Deployment experience: Went through the instructions in the readme, and when I tried to deploy I had to fix quite a few things. I needed to use heroku config commands to manage the config vars and I had my Procfile in the wrong folder so I moved that.
