I was successful in deploying my sight to Heroku. The toughest parts for me were
1. Figuring how to change the settings.py variables to use the .env file. Another
problem that I encountered was that my deployment kept getting an error message.
Honestly I don't know what the problem was but I followed this solution https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36665889/collectstatic-error-while-deploying-django-app-to-heroku

Something I'm wording is why my website lost its styling when being deployed. I guess
that is something to work on.
