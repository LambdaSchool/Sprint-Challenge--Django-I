Things seemed to start out fine... until I realized that all the dependencies were supposed to be installed in the repo I've been working on all week. I was under the impression that this sprint had its own pre-made project to be worked on. After realizing this grave error an hour in while being confused at the directions, I started working on the correct repo. Other blockers came towards the end when I tried to deploy. Thanks to my PM and SL I made MVP.
