What went well:
- Few issues with basic setup, didn't take very long
- Able to troubleshoot many things successfully

What was tricky:
- Had a couple issues that persisted in spite of many googles and attempts to fix
- Can be hard to tell what needs fixing sometimes or where the issues lies

How far I got:
- Created a superuser and migration was successful but app url doesn't work on heroku

I'm thinking I may do the entire project again from scratch later today or this weekend, feel like something went wrong while I was figuring django out that likely wouldn't happen on a second attempt. Overall feel decent with django.
