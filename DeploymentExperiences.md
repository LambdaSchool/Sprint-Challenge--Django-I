Following the README.md provided gudiance and support to get throught the deployment. I had an heroku installed and was able to login. I had a lot of trouble with heroku configs, because I didn't have them setup. I was able to do so with CLI. I successfully deployed but got a "BAD REQUEST" error. Eventually I was able to figure out what was wrong with my code, with help from a fellow student: my heroku configs were not setup properly.
