The overall experience was pretty rough, it is pretty simple looking back at it now.

Everything went well up until I had an h14 error when trying to access the site.
I looked it up and found out it had something to do with the Procfile, everything looked fine...

So I looked for about an hour or two until I noticed I named the Procfile 'ProcFile', 
I changed that and everyting worked fine.
