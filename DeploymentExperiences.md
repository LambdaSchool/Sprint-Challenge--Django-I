Following the deployment instructions was really clear but it took me more than 3 hours to be able
to deploy my backend to Heroku.

One of the blockers I had was that I didn't remember that I needed to set up my Config variables
in Heroku. That wasn't difficult but I just didn't remember.

Installing all the modules was easy.

The most difficult or tricky part was getting the 'Settings.py' file right, specifically the DATABASES set up.

I deloyed my backend twice because the first time, when I navigated to my admin site, the CSS wasn't working. You could
see the login form but with no CSS. I refactored my settings.py file and deployed it again to Heroku and now it is working.
