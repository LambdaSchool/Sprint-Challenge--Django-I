# Deployment

1. Repo Link: [Intro-Django](https://github.com/wvandolah/Intro-Django)
2. Deployment Link: [Heroku](https://fast-waters-75018.herokuapp.com/)  

## Deployment Experience
Deployment to heroku went super smooth.  Read thru all the [getting-started-with-python](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python) first then followed the [README](./README.md) provided in the repo.  I did get an error "No directory at: {}" after following the steps to setup the whitenoise genorater.  I fixed this by adding an empty staticfiles folder. I need to do more research on what exactly this middleware is  doing.  Overall, the actually deployment to heroku is very straight forward and simple.
