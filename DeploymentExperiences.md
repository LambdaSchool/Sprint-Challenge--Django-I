With the sprint challenge being a new repo and relying on an old one there were a few kinks in the process of copying the app over to the new repo. Also, there was a significant number of dependencies that I didn't fully understand the purpose of, which made debugging later more complicated. Another thing that tripped me up was the different ways to update repos with 'git push heroku master' and 'heroku run python manage.py migrate'. They seemed to function similarly and led to a source of confusion trying to figure out which one was appropriate for any given situation. Finally, when debug mode is off for production the server errors are generic and hard to, well, debug. Remembering to turn debug mode back on saved me from a major headache.
