For this sprint challenge, I was able to get to the point of deploying to heroku.  However, once I reached that point troubles arose.  As each time that I attempted to create a superuser or migrate an error would occur.  The first time around was an error with the cors-headers so I removed that from my project in order to see if it would work, have not added it back yet since I have not been able to fix the issue of migrating to database.  After that error was fixed, I would get an error telling me that my ENGINE variable was not properly configured or something to that effect.  So I decided to add an ENGINE variable into my .env file and to heroku's configs as well and passed this value to DATABASES['default']['ENGINE'] and the url value to DATABASES['default']['NAME'] and that fixed the problem of the ENGINE variable error.  However, now I'm running into an operational error which states that I cannot connect to server as there is no such file or directory.
