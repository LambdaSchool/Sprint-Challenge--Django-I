- Summarize the key steps in the deployment process. 
    All things considered the project went pretty well. Unfortunately I was absent for the majority of the week due to life. But I was able to successfully deploy and get my application on the internet.
  - What went well?
    The instructions for this project and proceeding sprint were very clear and concise; and truly helped to get the project up and running. I was able to methodically implement the instructions to ensure a seamless deployment.
  - What challenges did you face? 
    Not many challenges; I had a small problem with setting up the DATABASES within settings.py; and then forgetting to commit before attempting heroku deploy.
  - How far did you get?
    Full deployment of application. Only issue is my migrations didn't seem to save on heroku so I was not able to access auth_user table to create a super-user to start manipulating data.
- We have utilized docs from several different projects over the course of this Sprint.
  - Which docs did you think were the most helpful? 
    I found the links to the docs for each package were the most useful as I was able to review those docs to ensure that my implementation of the package was correct both in syntax and location.
  - Name one or two specific things about this resource that you think sets it apart from other docs you have referenced in the past. 
    I'm not entirely sure what this is referring to. I typically reference the doc links provided in readme's as they provide the most accurate information regarding the implementation of the specific package.
