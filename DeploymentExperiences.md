              My Deployment Process by Joseph Chretien

    This week's Sprint was a challenge in the non-traditional sense. More than an excersize in learning a new framework, this Sprint and project was an excersize in following very precise directions. A few of my biggest challenges I recall were making sure I was in the correct shell and making sure my user information was up to date. On my first attempt to deploy I failed becuase my setting in the Heroku app under Config Vars were not set correctly. The following time I tried, to deploy, my code was not saved after making minor changes and the build failed yet again. After realizing that I'd have to double and tripple check all my settings and code to complete a successful build I tried for a third time and completed the Sprint by launching a successful build of the notes app.
