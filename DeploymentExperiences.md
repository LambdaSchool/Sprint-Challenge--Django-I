# My Deployment Experiences

It was helpful to be able to have the experience of deploying with Heroku.  Some things went well but I did run into issues.  Installation went fine but there were points where I went to read documentation.  At the end my app was deployed but a major issue I have is my migrations aren't sticking to the database.
