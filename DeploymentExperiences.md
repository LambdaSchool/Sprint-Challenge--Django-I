This week, I encountered below huddles:

1. Too many terminals
  - Finding out right terminal to enter my command was a demanding task.
  - Throughout the week, I had to work with three different shells, bash, Django, and Python. In addition, there were server status terminal and Heroku CLI I had to keep open.

2. Lack of the knwoledge of the big picture
  - Not fully understanding the whole structure/schema but blindsightedly following the instruction was frustrating especially when it's time to debug.
  - It would have been helpful if there were deeper explanations on Django structure and interactions between files before the Day 1 task.

3. So far, I could deploy the repo in Heroku. However, there was an error which prevented the app to be displayed in the URL. I am still trying to isolate the cause and resolve it.
