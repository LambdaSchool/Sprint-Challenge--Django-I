Deploying a Django application to the web was not as easy as I thought it will be. There are many configuration files within a Django project which increases the chances of an error occurring doing the deployment process. A single typo in a setting, model, or URL file can cause a Django application to break and display numerous error messages on the terminal, log, or web page. One of the first problems I had experience during the deployment process was not being able to execute a “git push heroku master” command. The reason I was receiving an error after executing this command was the Django project files were not located in the root directory of the repo where the .git folder is stored. Instead, the Django project files were located in a subdirectory in the repo. Therefore, I had reorganized the files in the repo and the command successfully executed afterwards. Another error message I had received during the deployment process was “improperly configured at /admin/”. This error message was displayed on the home page of the Heroku website and it was the result of having a misconfigured Procfile. I had forgotten to replace the word “gettingstarted” with the name of my Django project in the Procfile. After correctly configuring the Procfile file, I was able to view the admin page and log in to view the notes for each user.
