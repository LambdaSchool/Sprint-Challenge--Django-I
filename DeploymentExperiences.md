## The deployment process was harrowing to say the least. It went smoothly up until the deployment where I realized that I couldn't migrate because I installed the dependencies in the root and not in the project folder. Then I realized that my config variables were setup incorrectly, as well as the Database_URL. Once I solved all that I was finally able to pull up the page with Debug ON, but not off. It seems a lot more straightforward than it is. Dependencies and logic can be such a headache when writing code.
