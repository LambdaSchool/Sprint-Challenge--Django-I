All went well but a couple of errors that were fixed upon starting over. I am assuming it was a slight oversight on my part. That was my only challenge. I did finished albeit a bit late. I used all of the docs given respectfully and was very intrigued at how some of them were really well written and helpful. The heroku docs were definitely the most useful and had the best interface to navigate. It had examples and in-depth fixes if one the examples were causing issues.
