- Summarize the key steps in the deployment process. 
  - What went well?
    - Was able to successfully create an API that provides data based on the specific user logged in. Also utilizes tokens for authetification.
  - What challenges did you face? 
    - On the second day of four, there were problems with using the Django admin page to add entries into the database. This problem still persists but can be avoided. Throughout doing this project, the main problem that was encountered was simply fixing typographical errors.
    - Had trouble deploying because my pipfiles didn't contain the necesary dependencies.
  - How far did you get?
    - Was able to complete each day's (1-4) MVP, except for being able to use the Django admin page to add entries into the database.
    - The app deploys and api is showing
- We have utilized docs from several different projects over the course of this Sprint.
  - Which docs did you think were the most helpful?
    - Each day's guide doc that was given in the base repo was helpful in explaining the steps to set up the API.
    - Using the Django models doc was also helpful in knowing what types of objects are available and how to use them.
  - Name one or two specific things about this resource that you think sets it apart from other docs you have referenced in the past. 
    - The guide docs gave specific instructions on how to set up the API that were specific enough so that little outside knowledge was needed. It helped that it would even guide when to do research on something if it wee to go wrong.
    - The Django models doc was extensive but simply searching for what is known to be wanted for the database usually resulted in finding exactly what was needed quickly. It is set up neatly in a way that is easy to read. So knowing what to put into the code was smooth.
