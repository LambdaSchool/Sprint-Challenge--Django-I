The entire process was very frustrating for me. Internet was out in several buildings in a 5 mile radius from Wednesday to Saturday, and spotty on Sunday. On Thursday I went to a friend's place 15 miles away and halfway through the lecture we were also out of internet, nearby coffee shops were out of internet too. I managed to get most stuff done on Friday but I had alot of issues with my modules and was unable to ./manage.py runserver. I'm guessing it's because I started off the week on my desktop, and had to use my laptop on Thursday and Friday. Repeated steps to install dependencies and started over on Sunday but I am still facing similar issues. Will try again later on tonight.
