In my deployment experience for today's sprint challange, I have expereineced a lot of emotions good and bad. Dev ops can be daunting at times because of the anxiety I had waiting fot the code to compile from pushing from the command line. Moreover, when it didnt complie the first time it was expected. But, once I got to the third version and the second version, I began to feel a little down about my experince deploying. However, I was able to work through my let down and push through defeat to successfully compile  the code though heroku. 

Following the README.md did provide gudiance and support to get throught the deployment. I did not have any issues with heroku being I had it already installed and was able to login. The part that did give me trouble was heroku configs, because I did not set them. I was able to do so via dashboard and commandline. By setting my heroku env configs I was able to successfully deploy. I am happy with deployement
