Compared to regular website deployment, I find deploying to Heroku to be tedious. While I was able to setup the website alright the app inself refuses to be pushed to heroku. So I have a page with no app. I prefer using other deployment sites for my python apps. Then again it is Friday 13th; I should retry after midnight; Maybe I will have better success. :}
